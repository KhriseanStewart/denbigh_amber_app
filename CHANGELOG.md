# Change Log - Denbigh Amber App

## [2025.07.28] - Order Management & Multi-Farmer System Enhancements

### üîß Order System Overhaul

#### **Order Separation by Farmer**
- **Fixed:** Orders from different farmers are now properly separated instead of being grouped as one combined order
- **Issue:** Previously, when a user placed orders with multiple farmers in the same session, they appeared as a single combined order
- **Resolution:** Modified `OrderService.showOrdersForCustomer()` to create individual order entries for each farmer
- **Impact:** Each farmer now gets their own distinct order card on user order screen with proper farmer information display

#### **Farmer Order Management Separation**
- **Fixed:** Farmers now see only their own individual orders instead of combined multi-farmer orders
- **Issue:** `SalesAndOrdersService.getFilteredOrdersForFarmerManual()` was grouping orders by session and showing combined orders from multiple farmers
- **Resolution:** Replaced complex grouping logic with direct Firestore query filtering by farmer ID
- **Impact:** Each farmer sees their own orders separately with proper authorization and unique order IDs

#### **Farmer Information Display**
- **Enhanced:** User order screen now displays detailed farmer information for each order
- **Added:** `_buildFarmerInfo()` method that fetches and displays farmer name and farm name
- **Features:**
  - Farmer name display with fallback handling
  - Farm name when available
  - Consistent styling with green accent colors
  - Error handling for missing farmer data

### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Authorization Improvements

#### **Farmer Order Authorization**
- **Enhanced:** Robust farmer authorization system for order status updates
- **Security:** Added comprehensive document validation and farmer ID verification
- **Features:**
  - Document existence checks before status updates
  - Farmer ID authorization (farmers can only update their own orders)
  - Proper error handling to prevent app crashes
  - Detailed logging for debugging and security monitoring

#### **Firebase Exception Handling**
- **Fixed:** "FirebaseException ([cloud_firestore/not-found] Some requested document was not found.)" errors
- **Resolution:** Added proper document validation in `_updateOrderStatus()` method
- **Security:** Prevents unauthorized access to other farmers' orders
- **Stability:** Try-catch error handling prevents application crashes

### üé® UI/UX Improvements

#### **Product Card Farmer Count Indicators**
- **Verified:** Orange indicator system already properly implemented
- **Feature:** Shows farmer count when multiple farmers sell the same product
- **Behavior:** Only displays orange indicator badge when more than one farmer sells the product
- **Location:** User dashboard product cards with proper count display

#### **Order Display Enhancements**
- **Improved:** Individual order cards with farmer-specific information
- **Enhanced:** Order ID display consistency between user and farmer views

- **Styling:** Consistent card design with appropriate color coding

### üìä Data Flow Improvements

#### **Order Creation Process**
- **Maintained:** Cart grouping by farmer during checkout process
- **Enhanced:** Each farmer gets separate order document in Firestore
- **Preserved:** Order session ID for tracking related orders
- **Improved:** Customer information consistency across all farmer orders

#### **Order Retrieval Optimization**
- **Users:** Individual orders displayed with farmer information
- **Farmers:** Direct query filtering for improved performance
- **Consistency:** Order IDs match between user and farmer interfaces
- **Authorization:** Proper access control throughout the system

### üîÑ Service Layer Refactoring
